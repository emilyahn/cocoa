The Spanglish used was always the first part of the sentence in Spanish and the second part in English. That is not how I have experienced Spanglish in the past. This contributed my assessment for human-likeness.

Some of the way the spanish and english (spanglish) were used where not very natural. I understood it but it is not what I would typically see.

I had previously told them that we most likely had a common friend with "night" as their preference, but my partner kept choosing "afternoon" references. Is it possible we had nothing in common because it seemed like we went through everything?
